# Scala.meta 1.6.0

## Syntactic API

Our parser has been updated to implement recent additions to the language:
literal types ([SIP-23](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/42.type.html))
and trailing commas ([SIP-27](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/trailing-commas.html)).

These features are supported in the newly introduced [`Typelevel` family of dialects](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/blob/v1.6.0/scalameta/dialects/src/main/scala/scala/meta/dialects/package.scala#L135-L137)
that correspond to the recent releases of the Typelevel Scala compiler.
The upcoming Scala 2.12.2 release is also going to support these features,
so, shortly after it's out, we will update [the `Scala212` dialect](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/blob/v1.6.0/scalameta/dialects/src/main/scala/scala/meta/dialects/package.scala#L135-L137) as well.

## Semantic API

We are extremely excited to announce the first release of the scala.meta semantic API!
Our general idea for this module is to start small, and then progressively support
more and more functionality until we've covered most, if not all, use cases of scala.reflect.

In this first release, we're introducing the notion of a `Symbol`, i.e. a unique identifier of a definition,
and the accompanying `Ref.symbol` API that can be used to resolve references. This functionality is backed
by something that we call a semantic database, i.e. a storage of semantic information about Scala programs.
Our current implementation can create such a database from an instance of the Scala compiler
and save it to disk for future consumption.

In the near future, we're planning to rapidly iterate on the design and functionality of the semantic API.
As a result, until further notice, the semantic API will have experimental status.
This means lower than usual quality standards, but this also means an opportunity
to shape the future of Scala tooling together. We have already hacked some very cool functionality,
and more is to arrive soon!

## `contrib`

Scala.meta `contrib` is a new module that provides common utilities for handling scala.meta data structures.
This first release of `contrib` contains:

- an `Equal` type-class (similar to `cats.Eq` or `scalaz.Equal`) with instances
 to compare trees for either structural or syntactic equality.
- collection methods on `scala.meta.Tree` such as `find`, `contains`, `collectFirst` and `exists`.
- an `AssociatedComments` data type for finding leading and trailing comments for tree nodes.

More utilities are planned for future release, such as extracting `Seq[Stat]` from various trees and parsing docstrings.
Modules for interoperability with third-party libraries such as cats or scalaz have been considered as well.

As the module name suggests, contributions to `contrib` are very welcome!

## Cross-compilation against Scala 2.11 and 2.12

Since 1.6.0, we are committed to supporting scala.meta for two most recent major versions of Scala.
The library part of scala.meta supports entire Scala series (at the time of writing, this is `_2.11` or `_2.12`).
Our compiler plugins are built against most recent minor versions of supported Scala series
(at the time of writing, this is `_2.11.8` and `_2.12.1`).

Scala.meta still needs porting to Scala 2.10. Despite being two major version behind, Scala 2.10
is still used to develop sbt plugins, so at the time of writing it is quite relevant.
If you'd like to help us out with Scala 2.10 support, take a look at [#295](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/issues/295).

## Prerelease builds

We have set up an infrastructure that automatically publishes prerelease builds of scala.meta
after a pullrequest to scalameta/scalameta gets merged.

You can distinguish these builds from regular builds by looking at their version strings.
Prerelease versions contain a dash (e.g. `1.6.0-344-a9f6f83e`), while regular builds don't (e.g. `1.6.0`).
The portion after the dash includes the number of commits since v1.0.0 and the sha of the corresponding commit,
which allows to easily establish version precedence and look up associated code.
The most recent prerelease version can be found at
[https://bintray.com/scalameta/maven/scalameta/_latestVersion](https://bintray.com/scalameta/maven/scalameta/_latestVersion).

Prerelease builds are hosted on Bintray, so you'll need to explicitly add a Bintray resolver
to your sbt configuration to make use of them: `resolvers += Resolver.bintrayIvyRepo("scalameta", "maven")`.
